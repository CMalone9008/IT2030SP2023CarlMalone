Items learned in the course:
- Creating a Web application from scratch and adding details and information into.  Making the site functional for a user in the end.
- Towards the end we started getting into databases and how they are formed.  Being able to store user information is a huge step in working/creating a database.
- Adding validation to the project.  If the user inputs something incorrectly a request is thrown instructing the user to correct the mistake in order to continue.

Features that could be added:
1.  A search bar that allows the user to search the page using keywords/product id's.
2.  Adding a cart that most websites use in order to store a product for purchase now or future purchase.
3.  Not sure how it would work but adding a live chat feature that can allow the user to get in touch with someone as soon as possible with questions.
