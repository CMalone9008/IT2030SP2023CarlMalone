- I have a problem with my Tools page not working.  It is showing 2 syntax erros and I keep getting an error message when I try and click on the tools page.
- I also do not understand why in my FAQ page the questions and answers are not updating.  When I first worked on the FAQ I simpy put "Question 1:" and the answer as "Common question 1." when I went back and made some questions and answers it is not updating when I load the website(you can see them in my FAQ.cshtml).  Not sure what is going on.
